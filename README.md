## Introduction
- Umeed is a web application that aims to connect donors and NGOs. It is a platform where NGOs can register themselves and create a profile. Donors can view the profiles of the NGOs and donate to them. 
- It makes the process of donating to NGOs easier and more transparent. It also helps NGOs to reach out to more people and get the help they need.
- Umeed aims to solve the targeted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the United Nations. The SDGs are a universal call to action to end poverty, quality education, reduce inequality, and protect the planet. Umeed aims to help NGOs working towards these goals by providing them with the platform they need.
- NGOs are unorganized and scattered across the country. There is a lack of awarness about their work. There is a lack of transperancy in the process and no platform to connect donors and NGOs. Umeed aims to solve these problems.
